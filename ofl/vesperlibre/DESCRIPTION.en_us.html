Vesper has a classical foundation, but with an entirely modern appearance, making reading comfortable, but never boring. It works well to set long passages of text in languages that are written with the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and many others.

Vesper was started by Rob Keller in 2006 at the University of Reading. Experimentation with Devanagari calligraphy inspired Vesper's Latin letterforms. During the year of the MA program, the Latin and Devangari were simultaneously developed. Following graduation, the Latin was completed and released, but the Devanagari was set aside. In 2013 Kimya Gandhi began collaborating on the design, revising and expanding the design transforming it to the final version.
